        SOULD BOND SMP is a lifesteel smp by a 12 year boy name Garvbansal. I had made this smp to play with my friends. As a owner i had taken many measures to stabilize this server. I added many security such as , Anti Cheat , Anti X-Xray , etc. I also solved many problems like this server for both Minecraft Java Edition and Bedrock Edition so, the player playing in pocket edition they have a problem that they are dieing again and again so i added a plugin so that whenever a player dies by enviromental cause like by Zombie , Creeper , Iron Golem , Lava , Fell in void , etc they wil not lose their inventory only when they killed by a player then, they lose inventory and 1 heart.
